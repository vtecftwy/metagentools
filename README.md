<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This repository includes the code developed as part of our metagenomics
project.

The code is structured into general code and submodules to cover the
various aspects of the project:

General utility code to be used across the project: - `core`: general
code - `art`: use ART-ILLUMINA read simulator package from a jupyter
notebook - `wandb`: use to open, retrieve, use WandB runs and artifacts
accross the project

Submodules: - `cnn_virus` - `architecture` - `data` - `utils`

This is work in progress and aspects are probably broken. We cannot
provide support. Use at your own risk

Requirements: - python 3.10 is required for this package
